## __React Native__:
<p>
  React Native is an open-source framework for developing iOS and Android mobile applications. React Native allows 
  developers to use the React along with native platform capabilities to create mobile applications for multiple different mobile operating systems.
  React Native is a popular framework for developing hybrid mobile applications, allowing developers to use a single codebase in JavaScript for both iOS and  Android. In native mobile applications, developers must maintain two separate codebases, a Swift codebase for iOS and a Kotlin codebase for Android.

## __Xcode__:

### Swift
<p>
  Swift is a multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed for iOS. Swift is designed to work with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks. Swift also extends the Objective-C code previously written for iOS devices. Crypto Visual uses Swift to transition from native iOS to React Native through the implementation of splash screens and animations.
